# ot-domain-adaptation-mammography
Domain adaptation for mammography classification using Optimal Transport. This project investigates Wasserstein-based transport methods to mitigate domain shift between mammography datasets (CBIS-DDSM → VinDr-Mammo), improving lesion detection performance without retraining large CNNs for each imaging device.
